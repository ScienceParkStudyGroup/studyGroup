<h1><a name="one-hour-lesson">Making a one-hour lesson </a></h1>
There are two responsabilities for a one-hour lesson:
- Host: One is to host the session 
- Teacher: 
These two responsabilities can be merged (e.g. if you organise one session completely by yourself).

<h1><a name="one-hour-lesson">Making a one-hour lesson </a></h1>
Leading and making a one-hour lesson is maybe the most immediate way to contribute. You can either 
1. Create a new lesson repository inside the [lessons](lessons/) repositories. Name it with the date of the lesson, the subject and the person leading it. For instance `20190102_Shiny_demo_Joachim`  
2. Create a `README.md` file into that new repository. This file should contain:
  - the author(s) of the lesson
  - the topic of the lesson
  - the entrance level for that lesson i.e. "beginner", "false beginner" or "advanced" for instance. 
  - the prerequisites for that lesson (what do people need to know to go through the lesson)  
3. Learning outcome of the one-hour lesson

We use the [Markdown formatting language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format the `README.md` file for every lesson. 

<h1><a name="special-event">Organising a special event</a></h1>
Special events are longer Study Group sessions where we adress specific themes. For instance:  
- an afternoon on RNA-Seq (3 hours) to be able to have a short introduction and some hands-on time (cloud computing, plots). 
- a two-day Carpentry workshop 
- ipsum loret ...  
- ipsum loret ...  

<h1><a name="slack">Acting as one moderator/contributor in one of the Slack workspace</a></h1>
The Science Park Study Group has a Slack workspace. Join or find yours here: https://slack.com/signin/find  
Every scientist with a `@uva.nl` email adress can freely join.   

If you become a moderator for a channel (e.g. `#genomics`), you would:
- answer questions from other scientists.
- if you don't know, point the question to someone else (use the `@name` to point to someone in your answer). 
- make sure questions are being answered after one week or less.
