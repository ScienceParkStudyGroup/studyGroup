<h1><a name="one-hour-lesson">Making a one-hour lesson </a></h1>
A one-hour lesson can be anything from a classroom-like session to the demonstration of a software for instance. It can also be a presentation on a specific topic. 

<h2>Host and teacher roles</h2>  
There are two responsabilities for a one-hour lesson:  

- **Host**: the host has to book the room, create a new event on the website, advertise the event, create the lesson folder and the README file. The host will indicate how big will be the attendance (usually between 5 and 15). The host will also chair the session (introduce the teacher for instance).  
- **Teacher**: the person teaching the lesson.    
These two responsabilities can be merged (a person organsing an event and teaching it).  

**Host to-do list:**  
1. Create a new lesson repository inside the [lessons](lessons/) repositories. Name it with the date of the lesson, the subject and the person leading it. For instance `20190102_Shiny_demo_Joachim`    
2. Create a `README.md` file into that new repository. This file should contain:
  - the author(s) of the lesson
  - the topic of the lesson
  - the entrance level for that lesson i.e. "beginner", "false beginner" or "advanced" for instance. 
  - the prerequisites for that lesson (what do people need to know to go through the lesson)  
3. Learning outcome of the one-hour lesson (to be defined together with the teacher)

We use the [Markdown formatting language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format the `README.md` file for every lesson. 

**Teacher to-do list:**
1. Create lesson content! [Here are some practical tips from Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupHandbook/lessons.html) 
2. Make sure your lesson fits in one hour. Keep some time for introducing yourself (~5min) and wrapping up the session (~10min).

<h1><a name="special-event">Helping at a Carpentry workshop</a></h1>
We regularly organise Software and Data Carpentry workshop under the umbrella of the Science Park Study Group. To run these coding workshops as smoothly as possible, we always need motivated and code-enthusiast helpers to assist beginners and attendees in general.
Please contact <a href="mailto:m.galland@uva.nl">Marc</a> or <a href="mailto:L.Fokkens@uva.nl">Like</a> to get in touch.

<h2>Examples of Carpentry workshops</h2>
- January 2019: [Software Carpentry](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/2019-14-01-Amsterdam-Python-workshop/)
- March 2017: [Data Carpentry](https://aschuerch.github.io/2017-03-22-amsterdam/)

<h1><a name="slack">Acting as one moderator/contributor in one of the Slack workspace</a></h1>
The Science Park Study Group has a Slack workspace.   
Every UvA scientist with a `@uva.nl` email adress can freely join here: https://scienceparkstudygroup.slack.com/join/signup  

If you become a moderator for a channel (e.g. `#genomics`), you would:
- answer questions from other scientists.
- if you don't know, point the question to someone else (use the `@name` to point to someone in your answer). 
- make sure questions are being answered after one week or less.
