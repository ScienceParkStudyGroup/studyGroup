# README file for a one-hour study group lesson
First of all, thank you for the time you will spend shaping the lesson :heart: Much appreciated! :+1: :star:  
Below is a nice example of a good `README.md` file that you should make inside the lesson repository. The complete contribution guidelines are in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file available [here](https://github.com/ScienceParkStudyGroup/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Title of the lesson

- **Author**: Joachim Goedhart (Assistant Processor, Molecular Cytology)
- **Lesson Topic**: How to make a Shiny app in R/Rstudio
- **When and Where**: May 14th, 16-17h, G5.29
- **Preparation**: Bring your laptop, make sure that you have a working version of R/Rstudio. You may install these R packages: shiny, ggplot2, tidyr, magrittr, dplyr
- **Level**: Beginners; knowledge of R (or any other programming language) and ggplot2 is helpful but not required

## Prerequisites 
Write here what attendees should already know before coming to the lesson. For instance, if the lessons concern statistics then they should know some of the basic concepts (sampling, population, average, standard deviation etc.).

## Setup
In this section, explain how to get softwares and dataset that are required for the lesson (if any).  

### Softwares
For instance, if R and RStudio are required, you could write:
> You should have R and RStudio installed on your machine.   
Get R here: https://lib.ugent.be/CRAN/  
Get RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/   

### Datasets :
The best thing is to upload your datasets and all necessary files on a stable archive :inbox_tray: such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or on the [UvA Figshare account](https://uvaauas.figshare.com/).  
For Zenodo, there is a Science Park Study Group community :family: to host all Study Group related files: https://zenodo.org/communities/scienceparkstudygroup/.
