# an email template to recruit new board members

Dear ...[fill in the name of the person that you wish to recruit]..., 

With this email, I'd like to invite you to become an active core member of the Amsterdam Science Park Study Group. 

Since March 2017, the Amsterdam Science Study Group is helping researchers to get better regarding code & data skills 
and contributes to promote good practices in scientific programming. 
Values that relate to Open Science such as promoting easy free access to code, datasets and other developped tools are central 
to this little community. We also try to be as democratic, inclusive as possible. You can find all values here: http://www.mgalland.info/community-organization/

I'd like to tell you more about this informal yet useful local initiative and how it connects to the broader picture. Also see how it 
would fit with your work schedule, wishes and career development.

Would you be available on ...[fill in a date]... to discuss it over a coffee? 

All the best,
....[fill in your name]....on behalf of the Study Group board.
